## 🏁 Final Words

Building Monad Ping Pong Arena has been an exciting journey into the intersection of gaming and blockchain technology. The most rewarding aspect was creating a system where players can stake their tokens and compete for real rewards, all while owning and trading unique NFTs.

The biggest challenge was implementing a fair and transparent match result verification system that balances on-chain integrity with user experience. By developing a hybrid approach with admin verification showing actual game scores, we've created a solution that maintains the benefits of blockchain while addressing its limitations.

I believe this project demonstrates the potential of Monad for gaming applications and hope it inspires more developers to build engaging, skill-based games on the blockchain.
